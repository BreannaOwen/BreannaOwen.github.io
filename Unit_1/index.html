	<h2>What Makes Me, Me</h2>
		<p>Hi there, I'm a 22 year old living in Sydney, Australia. I currently work as the Marketing and Fundraising Coordinator at Foodbank NSW & ACT. When I'm not at work I like spending time with my friends at the beach and over the Christmas break we travel the world skiing. Because of my love for the snow, my favourite sport to watch is ariel skiing! I also have an arty side to me. Currently, I have an interest in leanring how to loom weave to create wall hangings.</p>

	<h2>Some Skills I Think I Have</h2>
		<li>Talking for hours about nothing valuable</li>
		<li>Looking after fake plants</li>
		<li>Not catching on to conversations because my friends talk with sarcasm</li>

	<h2>My Interests That Probably Won't Make Me Money</h2>
		<li>Loom weaving to create wall hangings that end up being dust collectors</li>
		<li>Being an awesome GoPro video taker on the slopes</li>

	<h2>I Say Things That Don't Make Sense</h2>
		<h4>Yeah?</h4>
		<p>I often get caught saying <i>yeah</i> in the wrong context. It's not a <i>yeah I got this</i> type of yeah, it's a <i>yeah?</i> is what I'm doing correct? It's pretty much a reasurrance <i>yeah</i>. I regularly get corrected of my misuse of the word.</p>
		<h4>What?</h4>
		<p>Like the <i>yeah</i> situation, I also use <i>what</i> as a question. But not just a rude <i>what</i> instead of <i>pardon</i> when you mishear something. I'm actually fulling immersed in the conversaion but my brain slips into lala land for a second or so, and I title my head to the side - right to be exact - and say <i>whaaaaaaaaaat?</i> I regularly get mimicked by my misuse of the word.</p>
